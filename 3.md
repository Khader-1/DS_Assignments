The given code segment consists of nested loops, so we need to analyze the time complexity of each loop and then multiply them together to determine the overall time complexity.

Let's analyze the innermost loop first:

```java
for (j = 4; j < n + 5; j = j + 1) {
	a = a + k / 2 - 9;
	k = k + 8 * j;
}
```

The loop iterates from 4 to `n + 4`, performing a constant number of operations (`O(1)`) in each iteration. Therefore, the time complexity of this loop is `O(n)`.

Now let's analyze the middle loop:

```java
for (j = 2 * n; j > 3; j--) {
	k = 65;
	a = a - 13;
	// Inner loop here (time complexity: O(n))
}
```

The middle loop iterates from `2 * n` to 4, decrementing `j` by 1 in each iteration. Inside the loop, there is another loop with time complexity `O(n)`. Therefore, the time complexity of the middle loop is also `O(n)`.

Finally, let's analyze the outer loop:

```java
i = 5;
while (i < n + 2) {
	// Middle loop here (time complexity: O(n))
	i = i * 3 + 1;
}
```

The outer loop starts with `i = 5` and continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`. In each iteration, it performs the middle loop with time complexity `O(n)` and updates `i` by multiplying it by 3 and adding 1. The number of iterations depends on the value of `n` and can be expressed as logarithmic to the base 3 of `(n + 2)/5`. Therefore, the time complexity of the outer loop is `O(log n)`.

Multiplying the time complexities of the nested loops together, we get:

`O(n) * O(n) * O(log n) = O(n^2 * log n)`

So, the overall time complexity of the given code segment is `O(n^2 * log n)`.
